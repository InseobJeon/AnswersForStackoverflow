If I were you, I will try like this

```jsx
class UserService {
  private getData(param, tried=3) {
    const url = (name: string) => {
      `https:///website.com/${name}/data`;
    }

    return this.http.get<Data>(url(param)).pipe(catchError(error => {
      if (tried < 0) {
        throw error;
      }
      // assign name, param's property as a new value
      param.name = 'newName';
      // then, call again with param with another name 
      // while tried counter to be 0
      this.getData(param, tried - 1);
    }));  
  }
}
```

1. Add a new parameter `tried` to `getData` method to handle infinite loop of retrying. And set it's default value as 3(Maybe 5, 7, what else as you like)
2. Use your method which using the `http` method of `NestJS` and `.pipe`.
3. Then If this request got an error, retried to the renewed parameter with another name, like assigning `param.name = 'newName'` I wrote.
4. Call this `getData` method recursively with dicsount -1 from the `tried` parameter.

May this helps you.
